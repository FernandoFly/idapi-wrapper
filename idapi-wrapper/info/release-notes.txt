====================
- Initial release of this file
- Uploader, now has a new uploadFileAsStream method which can be used to upload large files, streamed directly from disk (no loading in memory first)
- Authenticator class.  It does nothing, but creates an instance, and logs in
- FileRemover class.  Use it to delete files (or folders)
- FolderCreator class. no need to explain
- FileCopier.  No need to explain
- FileLister.  Used to get the contents of a folder.
- Permission system has been added to the entire framework.  Now you can call setPermissions or addPermission on any instance class to set privileges for anything that creates content (SubmitJob, ExecuteReport with save, Upload, CreateFolder, etc).  The syntax for both methods is setPermissions/addPermission(user, role, privilegeString).  Either user or role has to be null.
- PermissionSetter class.  Besides the new permission system, this one can be used to set permissions on any object.  It also has a setRecursivePermissions method which will recurse a folder.  When setting permissions, you can also opt to add to the existing permissions (default), or replace the permissions
